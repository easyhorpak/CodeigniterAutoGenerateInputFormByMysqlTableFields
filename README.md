Codeigniter for Auto Generate Input Form By Mysql Table Fields

The project is Codeigniter Auto Generate HTML Input Form By get field 's name from Mysql Table.
I created this project because I don't need to create html input form every time when I create new mysql table.
It helps me coding fast but I think Uncle Bobs doesn't like this. My code still dirty and it looks complex.

Please comment about your think on my code and my idea.

Thank you.
